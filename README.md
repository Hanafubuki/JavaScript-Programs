Each program was created with different purposes.

Processor and visualizeitor were created to improve my skills about javascript and jquery (developed at University).

Blog was created to learn about React, Ruby on Rails and how to integrate both languages, without any focus on layout.

Askrick was created to improve my JavaScript knowledge utilizing React, Flux, Redux and WebPack. I also use SASS and in the future I want to add the back-end features using PHP (still working in this project).

Duvel was created to improve my basic CSS and JavaScript knowledge.
